The mmap() function is a system call in Unix and Unix-like operating systems that allows a process to map a portion of its virtual address space
to a file or a device. This function can be used for various purposes, such as memory-mapped I/O, inter-process communication, and loading executable 
code from shared libraries. By mapping a portion of a file or device to memory, the process can directly access its contents as if they were in memory,
without the need for additional I/O operations. The mmap() function returns a pointer to the mapped area in memory, which can be used by the process to 
read from or write to the file or device. The function takes several arguments, including the starting address of the mapping, the length of the mapping, 
the protection flags, and the file descriptor or device to be mapped.
